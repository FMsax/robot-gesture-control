# Methodology: Robot Gesture Control

## 1. Overview

This project controls a humanoid robot using voice commands and pose detection.  
It supports multiple GUI frameworks (PyQt5, PySimpleGUI) and ensures smooth command execution to Arduino.

---

## 2. Pose Detection

- **Mediapipe Holistic / Pose:**  
  Detects joint landmarks (wrists, shoulders, nose, eyes) and facial landmarks.
- **Logic:**  
  - Left/Right Arm: Compare wrist Y vs shoulder Y
  - Head Tilt: Compare nose Y vs eye midline
  - Eye and eyelid state: Measure landmark distances

---

## 3. Voice Control

- **PyAudio + Whisper / Vosk:**  
  Captures microphone input in real time
- **Command mapping:**  
  Uses JSON-like internal structure for phrase-to-command mapping
- **Smoothing:**  
  Avoids flooding Arduino with repeated commands by throttling command send interval

---

## 4. Arduino Integration

- **COM Port & Baud Rate:** Configurable
- **Smooth sending logic:** Ensures reliable motion commands
- **Reset commands:** Returns robot to neutral pose

---

## 5. GUI Design

- **PyQt5 GUI:** Professional layout with camera feed, logs, manual override buttons, and system controls
- **PySimpleGUI GUI:** Lightweight, easily modifiable alternative
- **Logging:** Timestamped logs for debugging

---

## 6. Data Handling

- **State memory:** Tracks last command per joint to avoid redundancy
- **Video frames:** Captured, flipped, and optionally annotated with landmarks
- **Logs:** Maintained in GUI and optional output files

---

## 7. Recommended Improvements

- Add JSON export of captured poses & audio for ML dataset creation
- Implement multi-threading for audio and video to avoid frame drops
- Add benchmarking of command latency and pose detection accuracy
